# Task-Relevant-Knowledge-Identification-Eye-tracking
Identifying Task-Relevant Knowledge in Natural Language Software Engineering Artifacts Using Eye-Tracking


## Purpose

To complete a software development task, a software developer often seeks information in many textual software artifacts, as in web pages of API documentation, bug reports, or community forums. These artifacts often hold information that assists in questions asked by developers during a programming task. However, such artifacts may contain substantial information and locating just the parts that are relevant to the developerâ€™s task may be a cognitively demanding activity. To reduce the amount of information that a developer must process, tools that automatically identify sentences based on the task being performed are desired. In this study, we seek to understand a developer's intrinsic perception of relevant text through how they read and gaze natural language artifacts available about a software project. The study uses eye-tracking technology (software and hardware) to collect the text read by the participants in a non-disruptive way. We investigate what information software developers perceive as relevant when they are performing software tasks such that potential results from our study can assist in the design of tools able to automatically identify task-relevant 

## Risks & Data

The eye-tracker does not incur any physically invasive procedures and the risks involved in this study are those commonly associated with the use of computers, such as potential eye, wrist, or neck strain.

Data collected by the researchers will be anonymized, and eye-tracker log data or calibration profiles will not identify participants. We will identify participants by numbers or pseudonyms in any internal or academic research publication or presentation. At any point in time will employers have access to the identifying information.

All data will be anonymized before and will not contain any identifying information. A sample of the anonymized data is included as part of the samples folder.

## Benefits

The results of this study will help our understanding of a developer's intrinsic perception of task-relevant information in software artifacts. Participants can directly benefit from this study by reflecting on their information-seeking behaviour and how they locate information. Direct benefits can arise if our findings lead to tools that can automatically identify relevant information so as to assist participants in their daily information-seeking activities.
